# Librarian
A data access library designed to allow beginner/inexperienced programmers to easily access data

Purpose:

1) To make it as easy as possible for people to access your data programmatically (democratisation!)
2) To act as a data layer to encapsualte how data is stored and retreived

Intended end point:

People can make one simple request (e.g. data category and identifier) and get back the information they want into memory.  Script will identify the nature of the data wanted, locate and download it.
